\title{Niche Equivalency Test}

\description{Run a niche equivalency test (see Warren et al 2008) based on two species occurrence density grids.}

\usage{ecospat.niche.equivalency.test (z1, z2, rep)}

\arguments{
  \item{z1}{Species 1 occurrence density grid created by \code{ecospat.grid.clim}.}
  \item{z2}{Species 2 occurrence density grid created by \code{ecospat.grid.clim}.}
  \item{rep}{The number of replications to perform.}
}

\details{Compares the observed niche overlap between z1 and z2 to overlaps between random niches z1.sim and z2.sim, which are built from random reallocations of occurences of z1 and z2.}

\value{a list with $obs = observed overlaps, $sim = simulated overlaps, $p.D = p-value of the test on D, $p.I = p-value of the test on I.}
